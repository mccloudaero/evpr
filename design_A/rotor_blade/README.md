# Rotor Blade Info
The rotor blades are made from foam and fiberglass with a carbon-fiber stiffener. The rotor shaft is embedded in the blade and rivets are used to attach the shaft due to the loads and vibration.

# Design Notes
Propeller designs are specific to the application for which they are used. The specific design and analysis results included in this repository are for the [Goliath quadcopter](https://github.com/mccloudaero/goliath-quadcopter).

# Build Notes
* Tool paths for machining the rotor cores is included in this directory.
	* Cut stock block to 17"x8"x1.75"
* STL file is available for creating your own tool paths
