# Servo Sizing for EVPR
The servo needs to be sized according to the intended application. Airfoil selection should consider the section pitching moment. The blade torque needs to be determined by analysis (or testing). Once the required blade torque is known, the gear ratio and the required servo torque can be determined. The figure below shows the required blade torque.
