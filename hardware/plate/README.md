# Rotor Plates
Both plates have the same outline, but differ in which side the pockets are on and if the PCB mounting holes are present.
Plate one is designed to hold the PCB (4-40 mounting holes).
Plate two is a mirror of plate one, and doesn't have the PCB mounting holes.

For a CCW rotor, plate one is on the bottom. For a CW rotor, plate one is on the top.
