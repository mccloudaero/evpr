# Rotor Blade Info
The rotor blades are made from foam and fiberglass with a carbon-fiber stiffener. The rotor shaft is embedded in the blade and rivets are used to attach the shaft due to the loads and vibration.

# Design Notes
Create profiles and export to txt file, tab delimited
## CAD
* Import txt files, fit as spline
* Set the rotation point at the quarter chord along the chord axis
* Rotate around the quater chord point to the correct angle

# Build Notes
* Tool paths for machining the rotor cores is included in this directory.
	* Cut stock block to 17"x8"x1.75"
* STL file is available for creating your own tool paths
